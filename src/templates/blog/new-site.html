<p class="lead">
	Welcome to my fancy new site!
</p>

<p>
	I decided to rebuild my website entirely. Recently things like <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">GruntJS</a>, <a href="http://nodejs.org/">NodeJS</a> and static site generators have been grabbing my attention. My workflow has changed dramatically; now it relies mostly on NodeJS & GruntJS running in the background to compile my code (SASS, JavaScript minification, etc.) and run a local webserver. It's only a logical step forward to use one of the new fancy static site generators to create my personal site rather than something like WordPress.
</p>

<p>
	One of the most popular static site generators is <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, but since all of my local development is aided by JavaScript-y stuff, I went in search for a GruntJS solution for generating static sites. So, here comes <a href="http://assemble.io/">Grunt Assemble</a>! Assemble runs as a Grunt task to compile .hbs files (using <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/">Handlebars</a> templates) into static .html pages.
</p>

<p>
	So far I've built out the basic structure of this site using Assemble and I'm very happy with it. Assemble was easy to learn (spent about a day learning it and another putting together this site). The blog was a tricky one to get working and there are still a few things I need to work on:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>Date formatted permalinks for blog posts</li>
	<li>Blog posts in chronological order</li>
	<li>Work section of the site</li>
</ol>

<p>
	Anyway, thanks for stopping by my new site! Catch me on twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/dganoff">@dganoff</a> anytime :).
