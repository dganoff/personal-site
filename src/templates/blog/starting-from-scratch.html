<p class="lead">
	Creating this new site was a lot of fun and a great learning experience, so I'd like to share some of the new technologies I used to build it.
</p>

<h3>A New Workflow</h3>
<p>
	Learning to use <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">GruntJS</a> was a huge turning point in my development workflow. I now use grunt to: run a local web server, live-reload <em>any</em> changed files, compile SASS (scss) into CSS, minify & concatenate my JavaScript, compile my static HTML files, and even deploy changes to GitHub pages. Below is a list of all the grunt goodness that was used:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		<a href="https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-uglify">Grunt Uglify</a><br>
		JavaScript minification
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-connect">Grunt Connect</a><br>
		local web server with livereload
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch">Grunt Watch</a><br>
		watch any files for changes and trigger livereload
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-sass">Grunt SASS</a><br>
		compile SASS into CSS
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="https://github.com/assemble/assemble">Grunt Assemble</a><br>
		compile .hbs, .md into .html
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-copy">Grunt Copy</a><br>
		copy assets from source folder to distribution folder upon build
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-concat">Grunt Concat</a><br>
		concatenate JavaScript files in order
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="https://github.com/tschaub/grunt-gh-pages">Grunt GH Pages</a><br>
		create/update GitHub page branch for easy deployment
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-clean">Grunt Clean</a><br>
		removes certain files from the distribution folder upon build
	</li>
</ol>

<h4>Bower Package Manager</h4>
<p>
	Another awesome part of my new workflow utilizes <a href="http://bower.io/">Twitter's Bower package manager</a>. It's a npm module that downloads third-party (or your own) development assets such as JavaScript or CSS libraries instead of you having to manually find the files yourself. There's a bower.json file you can use to manager the packages for a project. You can specify what version of the library you need, or simply say you want the "latest" version. 
</p>
<p>
	For this project I've used bower to include <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>, <a href="http://bourbon.io/">Bourbon SASS mixin library</a> and <a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/">Font Awesome</a> icon fonts. As time goes on, I'm sure I will add more dev dependencies as I need them.
</p>

<h4>Styling with SASS and Bourbon</h4>
<p>
	I'm still addicted to SASS. Even though I've switched my entire workflow over to NodeJS, I can't let go of SASS (ruby gem). I honestly haven't tried LESS yet and I'm a bit scared to make the transition. Since Grunt allows me to compile SASS fairly quickly, I'm going to stick to it for now.
</p>
<p>
	I brought in Bourbon so that I wouldn't have to rely on yet another ruby gem for a mixin library (compass). I loved compass, but bourbon seems to be fulfilling my needs just the same.
</p>
<h5>No CSS frameworks...</h5>
<p>
	I decided not to start with any frameworks like Zurb Foundation or Twitter Bootstrap because I wanted to keep this project limited to just what I needed (for the most part). I created my own simple responsive grid system that's based on Foundation's. As I need more features on the site, I'll try to create them on my own with the help of bourbon.
</p>
<p>
	Here's how I created the simple responsive grids (mobile-first):
</p>

<h5>HTML Markup:</h5>
<pre>
<code class="language-markup">&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;grid-3 columns&quot;&gt;25% width grid&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;grid-3 columns&quot;&gt;25% width grid&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;grid-3 columns&quot;&gt;25% width grid&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;grid-3 columns&quot;&gt;25% width grid&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code>
</pre>

<h5>SCSS:</h5>
<p>This assumes you have already set values to the variables: <code>$container</code>, <code>$gutter</code>, <code>$columns</code>, and <code>$small-screen</code></p>
<pre>
<code class="language-css">.row {
	position: relative;
	width: 100%;
	margin: 0 auto;
	max-width: $container;
	@include clearfix;

	.row {
		width: auto;
		margin-left: -$gutter;
		margin-right: -$gutter;
		max-width: none;
	}
}

.columns {
	position: relative;
	float: left;
	padding: $gutter;
}

[class^="grid-"] {
	position: relative;
	width: 100%;
}

@for $i from 1 through $columns {
	.grid-#{$i} {

		@media (min-width: $small-screen) {
			width: percentage($i/$columns);
		}
	}

	.small-grid-#{$i} {
		width: percentage($i/$columns);
	}
}</code>
</pre>

<h4>That's about it...</h4>
<p>
	I'd like to go into more detail about how I used Grunt Assemble to build this site statically and the benefits, but as you can see this post is already getting super long. Thanks if you made it this far!
